# Submissions
- There are a couple ways to submit your song:
    - **Submission Form**:  The best and easiest way to submit your own converted music is to visit this [Site](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwetNkcuX68j1hSMt0U2F_xmTHFe3hQp6my3cnHXwxICMJVt5NTyD8_aYcrMqEuSwuyfQ/exec) and follow the instructions
    - **Directly from Github**: The second way is to create your own Github Fork and add your Binary, and MP3 Files (Don't submit MP3 if you plan on using a Youtube link instead). You then want to make a Pull Request with your files into `theballaam96:main` branch. In your PR you then want to edit this comment:
        ```IS SONG - DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE
        Game: <GAME NAME>
        Song: <SONG NAME>
        Category: <CATEGORY NAME: bgm | events | majoritems | minoritems>
        Composers: <COMPOSERS DELIMITED BY ,>
        Converters: <CONVERTERS DELIMITED BY ,>
        Audio: <URL TO YOUTUBE VIDEO>

        Additional Notes: <NOTES TO BE DISPLAYED ON PACK BUILDER SITE>

- After you submit your song, the Music Verifiers will review it and will either accept or decline it. If your submission is declined for any reason, one of the Music Verifiers will leave a comment in your pull request explaining the reason for the decline. You will know if your submission got accepted when we merge your Pull Request into the Main repository.
# Acceptable Song Submissions
- We will only accept songs converted from Video Game Music. There are some exceptions to Video Game Music that are not allowed:
   - **Licensed Video Game Music**: Some example include songs from the Guitar Hero Franchise such as Through The Fire and Flames
   - **Kingdom Hearts**: Most Kingdom Heart music will not be accepted since they tend to be easily caught by DMCA
